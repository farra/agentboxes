# schmux-baked: Schmux on wolfi-toolbox with all tools pre-installed
#
# This is a baked image with all tools pre-installed. Larger than slim
# (~500MB-2GB) but ready to use immediately without first-boot setup.
#
# Trade-offs vs schmux (slim):
# - Larger image size
# - No first-boot wait
# - Still uses wolfi-toolbox base (not fully Nix-reproducible)
#
# For fully reproducible Nix images, use schmux-full.toml
#
# Build: nix build .#schmux-baked-image
# Load: docker load < result
# Use: distrobox create --image schmux-baked:latest --name dev
