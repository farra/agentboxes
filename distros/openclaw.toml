# openclaw: OpenClaw orchestrator environment (slim bootstrap)
#
# This is a slim bootstrap image. On first boot, it automatically runs
# `just bootstrap` to install the full environment via nix profile.
#
# Slim images are smaller (~300MB vs 2GB+) but require first-boot setup.
# Use openclaw-baked.toml for a pre-installed image.
#
# Build: nix build .#openclaw-image
# Load: docker load < result
# Use: distrobox create --image openclaw:latest --name dev
