# openclaw-baked: OpenClaw on wolfi-toolbox with all tools pre-installed
#
# This is a baked image with all tools pre-installed. Larger than slim
# but ready to use immediately without first-boot setup.
#
# Trade-offs vs openclaw (slim):
# - Larger image size
# - No first-boot wait
# - Still uses wolfi-toolbox base (not fully Nix-reproducible)
#
# For fully reproducible Nix images, use openclaw-full.toml
#
# Build: nix build .#openclaw-baked-image
# Load: docker load < result
# Use: distrobox create --image openclaw-baked:latest --name dev
