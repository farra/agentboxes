# schmux-wolfi: Schmux on wolfi-toolbox base (smaller, faster)
#
# Uses ublue's wolfi-toolbox as base (~200MB) instead of pure Nix.
# Distrobox compatibility is handled by wolfi, Nix adds specialized tools.
#
# Trade-offs vs schmux-full:
# - Much smaller image (~500MB-2GB vs 11GB)
# - Faster distrobox entry (no verify step)
# - Less reproducible (wolfi base updates independently)
# - Agents can use `apk add` for runtime deps
#
# Build: nix build .#schmux-wolfi-image
